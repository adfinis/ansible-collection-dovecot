## Mailbox access control lists.
##

# vfile backend reads ACLs from "dovecot-acl" file from mail directory.
# You can also optionally give a global ACL directory path where ACLs are
# applied to all users' mailboxes. The global ACL directory contains
# one file for each mailbox, eg. INBOX or sub.mailbox. cache_secs parameter
# specifies how many seconds to wait between stat()ing dovecot-acl file
# to see if it changed.
plugin {
{% for acl in dovecot_acl %}
  acl{% if loop.counter > 1 %}{{ loop.counter }}{% endif %} = {{ acl }}
{% endfor %}
}

# To let users LIST mailboxes shared by other users, Dovecot needs a
# shared mailbox dictionary. For example:
plugin {
  acl_shared_dict = {{ dovecot_acl_shared_dict }}
}

plugin {
{% if dovecot_acl_anyone %}
  # By default Dovecot doesn't allow using the IMAP "anyone" or "authenticated"
  # identifier, because it would be an easy way to spam other users in the
  # system.
  acl_anyone = allow
{% endif %}

  acl_user = {{ dovecot_acl_user }}
}
