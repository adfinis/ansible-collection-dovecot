## Director-specific settings.
##

# Director can be used by Dovecot proxy to keep a temporary user -> mail server
# mapping. As long as user has simultaneous connections, the user is always
# redirected to the same server. Each proxy server is running its own director
# process, and the directors are communicating the state to each others.
# Directors are mainly useful with NFS-like setups.

# List of IPs or hostnames to all director servers, including ourself.
# Ports can be specified as ip:port. The default port is the same as
# what director service's inet_listener is using.
director_servers = {{ dovecot_director_servers | join(' ') }}

# List of IPs or hostnames to all backend mail servers. Ranges are allowed
# too, like 10.0.0.10-10.0.0.30.
director_mail_servers = {{ dovecot_director_mail_servers | join(' ') }}

# How long to redirect users to a specific server after it no longer has
# any connections.
director_user_expire = {{ dovecot_director_user_expire }}

# How the username is translated before being hashed. Useful values include
# %Ln if user can log in with or without @domain, %Ld if mailboxes are shared
# within domain.
director_username_hash = {{ dovecot_director_username_hash }}

# To enable director service, uncomment the modes and assign a port.
